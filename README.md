# Assumptions of LIBOR Data Analysis

This project shows the importance of testing the probabilistic assumptions (distribution, dependence, heterogeneity) of your data set before conducting any analysis on said data.

The files below were run in the following order
- <em>1) Get Normal resids, Analyze resids of Student's T Regression.py</em>
- <em>2) Run Student's T Regression.R</em>
- <em>1) Get Normal resids, Analyze resids of Student's T Regression.py</em>

The Python file is listed twice because after running the first half, then the second half needs the Student T residuals generated from the R file.
